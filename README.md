# Food portal
Wouldn't you like to have recipes and diets fitting your fridge? We are publicly creating an app to show what to eat by selecting how much time you have to cook, what kind of appliances are available to you (e.g. only microwave), which diet are you following, and which ingredients you have in your kitchen.

## Introduction
* **Health is food-dependent** - There is much truth in “you are what you eat”, but human organisms do not use food only for construction. We also eat to boost our immune system with vitamins, improve focus with magnesium, have energy throughout the day with proteins, and much more. Food chemistry is still the area of many studies, as many biological processes remain a mystery. Facilitating information about food and sharing volunteer reports on how do we feel after eating certain dishes could be beneficial towards our understanding of food.
* **Information on food is scattered** - The Internet has plenty of articles on food. Many of them are research papers published by scientists on PubMed, but most of them are published on blogs. The latter is easier to read and usually consists of recipes, but rarely attach sources for their statements, which makes them not reliable. Creating a website combining those two would be great for our health and taste.
* There are many different versions of dishes
* Following a strict diet is not easy

## To do
* **Database of diets and recipes** - Cooking suggester that personalizes/adjusts to Person’s allergies, time, available ingredients, and appliances (e.g. I have only frying pan).
